# 🚗 Cars24 Used Car Data Analysis

This project examines and analyses a dataset of used cars from Cars24 to identify insights into pricing trends, mileage, fuel type, seller type, and other factors influencing car resale value.  
The analysis is conducted using Python libraries, including **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset, including handling of outliers.
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key trends.
- Visualise relationships between car features and price.
- Derive insights about factors influencing resale value.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Car's resale price strongly depends on factors like **Brand and model of the car, engine displacement and maximum power**.
- Diesel cars tend to retain higher resale value compared to petrol cars.
- Cars from dealer sellers often show higher listed prices than individual sellers.
- Higher engine power and mileage generally correlate with better pricing.
- Age of the car too is a key indicator of its resale value; the more aged the vehicle, the resale value is seen dropping down correspondingly.

## 📈 Visualizations
The project includes:
- Distribution plots between price and numerical data like age, mileage, and km driven.
- Correlation heatmaps.
- Boxplots for fuel type, transmission type, dealer type vs. price. 
- Trend analysis for seller type, transmission, and ownership.
- Distribution graph per car brands. 

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Build predictive models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to estimate resale price.
- Deploy an interactive dashboard for better visualisation.
